Powered by EA’s Frostbite 3, the game has been confirmed to have a whole new cast, “more freedom,” and “reote hostile planets” that is “teeming with alien life and civilizations.” With this game, the story seems to be focusing on finding a new home for humanity within the Andromeda system.http://www.bagogames.com/mass-effect-andromeda-2/.
